ClusterBuilderManual
====================

A guide on how to build a cluster. Note, there are many interpretations on how to build a cluster. Ultimately it depends on the workload that the cluster is going to be doing. This guide is meant to be used as a learning experience as well as a good reference for other cluster admins.

I started this guide as just a collection of notes that I took when I build clusters. I organized them on a wiki for a time, but they were not complete nor without occasional errors. A friend, almightybeej, cleaned up a significant portion of the manual and added screenshots for the installation.

Now I find that the notes are getting stale and have a few errors simply due to the nature of ever-changing and evolving software. Thus, I have decided to once again update the notes. However, I would like to better track changes and I would love to expand on these notes to include more on how to use and manage the cluster so I decided to use git as a way to manage the updates. Since git doesn't handle pdf or odf very well, I decided to try markdown after a recommendation from one of the puppet developers. At this time, I am using the markdown format needed for the document to be hosted on the github repository. All edits should be on the wiki for the time being.
