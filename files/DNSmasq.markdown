# Why DNSmasq
When there are many nodes in the cluster, installing, and managing the network infrastructure is way too much overhead for anyone to manage. Installing DNSmasq works really well for managing a TFTP boot process for automatic installations and also takes care of managing the details of IPs and name resolutions. It is very convienent, simple, and I have found that it scales well at least up to over 400 compute nodes.
