# List of packages
Please note, that the packages are subject to change by the original authors who do not cosult me at all... Thus, I will list the versions that I test with but I can't be certain this guide will work for all versions.  
## Required packages

[Blas](http://www.netlib.org/blas/blas.tgz) - This link should always point to the latest version.  
[FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/fftw-2.1.5.tar.gz) - 2.1.5 is the latest of the 2.x series and works best with cbench.  
[LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/)
[Maui](http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/support-old/download-center/maui-cluster-scheduler/) - Note: you have to have an account to download this software. Registration is free and this link should take you do the download page once you are signed in.  
[Torque](https://github.com/adaptivecomputing/torque) - 4.2.2  


## Helpful packages
These packages are ones which should be auto-downloaded via scripts, but they may be useful to have on standby if you are on a internet-restricted connection.
